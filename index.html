                  RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking at the time one of the deadliest of a single ship[a] and the deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship to date.[4] With much public attention in the aftermath, the disaster has since been the material of many artistic works and a founding material of the disaster film genre.

RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, chief naval architect of the shipyard at the time, died in the disaster.

Titanic was under the command of Captain Edward Smith, who went down with the ship. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland, Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States. The first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with a gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants, and opulent cabins. A high-powered radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger "marconigrams" and for the ship's operational use. The Titanic had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors. The ship carried 16 lifeboat davits which could lower three lifeboats each, for a total of 48 boats. However, Titanic carried only a total of 20 lifeboats, four of which were collapsible and proved hard to launch during the sinking. The carried lifeboats were enough for 1,178 people—about half the number on board, and one third of her total capacity—due to the maritime safety regulations of those days. At the time of the sinking, the lowered lifeboats were only about half-filled.
After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland, before heading west to New York.[8] On 14 April, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (600 km) south of Newfoundland, she hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time. The collision caused the hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard (right) side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea; she could only survive four flooding. Meanwhile, passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partially loaded. A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a "women and children first" protocol for loading lifeboats.[9] At 2:20 am, she broke apart and foundered with well over one thousand people still aboard. Just under two hours after Titanic sank, the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived and brought aboard an estimated 710 survivors.
The disaster was met with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life, as well as the regulatory and operational failures that led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety. One of their most important legacies was the establishment of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) in 1914, which still governs maritime safety. Several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications—which could have saved many more passengers.
The wreck of Titanic was discovered in 1985 by a Franco-American expedition sponsored by the United States Navy.[11][12] The ship was split in two and is gradually disintegrating at a depth of 12,415 feet (2,069.2 fathoms; 3,784 m). Thousands of artefacts have been recovered and displayed at museums around the world. Titanic has become one of the most famous ships in history, depicted in numerous works of popular culture, including books, folk songs, films, exhibits, and memorials. Titanic is the second largest ocean liner wreck in the world, only being surpassed by her sister ship HMHS Britannic; however, she is the largest sunk while in service as a liner, as Britannic was in use as a hospital ship at the time of her sinking. The final survivor of the sinking, Millvina Dean, aged two months at the time, died in 2009 at the age of 97
The name Titanic derives from the Titans of Greek mythology. Built in Belfast, Ireland, in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the RMS Titanic was the second of the three Olympic-class ocean liners—the first was the RMS Olympic and the third was the HMHS Britannic.[13] Britannic was originally to be called Gigantic and was to be over 1,000 feet (300 m) long.[14] They were by far the largest vessels of the British shipping company White Star Line's fleet, which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912.[15] The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line's chairman, J. Bruce Ismay, and the American financier J. P. Morgan, who controlled the White Star Line's parent corporation, the International Mercantile Marine Co.

The White Star Line faced an increasing challenge from its main rivals Cunard, which had recently launched the Lusitania and the Mauretania—the fastest passenger ships then in service—and the German lines Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. Ismay preferred to compete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be larger than anything that had gone before as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury. The company sought an upgrade in their fleet primarily in response to the Cunard giants but also to replace their oldest pair of passenger ships still in service, being the SS Teutonic of 1889 and SS Majestic of 1890. Teutonic was replaced by Olympic while Majestic was replaced by Titanic. Majestic would be brought back into her old spot on White Star Line's New York service after Titanic's loss.

The ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilders Harland and Wolff, who had a long-established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867.[18] Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line; the usual approach was for the latter to sketch out a general concept which the former would take away and turn into a ship design. Cost considerations were relatively low on the agenda and Harland and Wolff was authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five percent profit margin.[18] In the case of the Olympic-class ships, a cost of £3 million (approximately £310 million in 2019) for the first two ships was agreed plus "extras to contract" and the usual five percent fee.

Harland and Wolff put their leading designers to work designing the Olympic-class vessels. The design was overseen by Lord Pirrie, a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; naval architect Thomas Andrews, the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews' deputy and responsible for calculating the ship's design, stability and trim; and Alexander Carlisle, the shipyard's chief draughtsman and general manager.[20] Carlisle's responsibilities included the decorations, equipment and all general arrangements, including the implementation of an efficient lifeboat davit design.

On 29 July 1908, Harland and Wolff presented the drawings to J. Bruce Ismay and other White Star Line executives. Ismay approved the design and signed three "letters of agreement" two days later, authorising the start of construction. At this point the first ship—which was later to become Olympic—had no name, but was referred to simply as "Number 400", as it was Harland and Wolff's four hundredth hull. Titanic was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number 40

There was a famine in the animal kingdom. This famine had lasted so long that any existing source of food had been completely depleted. The animals knew they had to do something real quick or they would all die off one by one. They called a meeting where every animal was in attendance and they determined that they had to do something drastic. It was decided that the mothers would be sacrificed to ensure the continuation of the animal races. They would eat their mothers
The dog was extremely sad because he loved his mother. He thought about this action a great deal and decided he was not going to sacrifice his mother. Instead, he hid her in the sky. Everyday, he would go to a particular spot where he sang a song asking his mother to drop a rope. 
His mother would drop a rope and the dog would climb to the sky where his mother would have a feast waiting for him. 
One day, as the dog was singing for his mother to drop the rope, the tortoise was passing by and hid himself to observe what was going on. He heard the song dog was singing, then he saw a rope being dropped from the sky and with which the dog climbed to the sky.
The following day, the tortoise went to the same spot and, disguising his voice like the dog’s, he sang the song he had heard the dog sing the day before. A rope dropped from the sky and the tortoise began to climb this rope. At this same time, the dog was just approaching the same spot when he saw the tortoise climbing to the sky. The dog immediately started to sing to his mother. This time, he sang that he was not the one climbing the rope and that his mother should cut the rope. Dog’s mother got a pair of scissors and cut the rope, sending the tortoise crashing to the ground.
This caused tortoise’ shell to break into several pieces. He managed to glue these pieces together, but that was how the tortoise ended up with the rough shell we know today. Imaria was born to the family of Opoki Riale in the village of Ebewen. He was a very beautiful and active child when he was born, but, one day, polio struck and disabled him. There was no prevention at that time. The mother took him to every doctor in Ebewen in the hope that one of them might be able to cure her son. After days of searching, it appeared that none of the doctors had the ability to rescue Imaria from the wrath of this disease. However, Imaria soon recovered, even though he now lacked the ability to walk.

Until he contracted polio, Imaria had grown up and belonged with every other child in Ebewen. Now he was subjected to seclusion, as his parents were ashamed to send a disabled child to school with individuals deemed more able. In spite of the efforts of Imaria’s friends to help him continue with his studies, his parents remained stubborn in their choice. However, Imaria soon took up farm work, which seemed to suit him.

Each time Imaria went to the farm, he passed through the village, which meant passing through Onofua’s house. Each time Onofua’s wife saw Imaria, she would mock him because of his walking ability. She would look at him and say, “Will this boy ever find a wife to marry?”  

Initially the little boy would laugh and draw his legs with the help of his cane. Gradually, the young man became conscious of the woman’s statement and considered it to be an insult.

When the woman repeated her taunts, he would cry, and tell his mother.  After each incident, his mother would tell him that if he achieved anything at all, then this woman would show him respect
Onofua and his wife had three daughters. One day, the most beautiful daughter fell ill. Just like Imaria’s parents, Onofua’s wife went to every doctor in the village. Yet again, no doctor could cure her. Her parents had lost hope that she would ever recover.
One late evening, as Imaria was returning from the farm, he met an old woman carrying firewood. She was tired and weak, and as he approached her, the old woman’s walking stick snapped. Imaria became sympathetic to the old woman and offered help. He gave the old woman his own walking stick and, in spite of his disability, helped her to carry her load. When they got to a junction, the old woman returned the stick and took the firewood. She thanked him and told him to touch her with the walking stick, which he did. The old woman then transformed into a very young girl.
She told him to take the walking stick home and use it to assist people suffering from illness. She told him that if he touched a sick person with a walking stick, they would heal. When Imaria got home, he found that his mother had fallen ill. Seizing the chance, he used the walking stick as he was instructed. Soon after, his mother became well.
Word of Imaria’s newly discovered magic passed through the village as his family began inviting sick people within the community to receive this strange treatment. Many came, and left Imaria’s home healed. However, when Onofua’s wife heard the news, she was afraid to take her daughter there. Her husband fell ill too. Still, she refused. Her neighbors forced her to take her husband to Imaria when his sickness became worse. She resisted, but eventually gave in to the pressure. As soon as they got there, Onofua was cured.
At the sight of this wonder, Onofua’s wife was persuaded to bring her daughter to Imaria in order to cure her. When she pleaded to Imaria for help, Imaria was adamant that he would only help on one condition. He would only heal this woman’s daughter if she married him when she became well. The mother pleaded again, but Imaria ignored her.
Onofua and his wife went home. Every time they saw their daughter suffer, they were filled with sadness. One day, they decided that it was better for their daughter to marry Imaria than to remain in her pains. So, they took her there and Imaria worked his magic. The daughter became well, and the wishes of her family and Imaria were fulfilled.
Because of his new and immense wealth that accumulated due to his gift, Imaria planned a wedding for himself and his bride to be. The events of the wedding brought one final gift. Watching their daughter dance, Onofua and his wife became regretful - their daughter was well, but what about Imaria? The effects of his disease were still present. Imaria was aware of this, too. He knew what to do. He tapped his right leg with the walking stick, and sure enough, he was able to stand fully. The family then forgot about their sorrows, and began to dance in happiness. Imaria and his wife were safe, and everything was going to be okay.

In spite of repeated entreaties from her parents, she refused to marry any man from her land. She vowed to marry a rich prince from a far away kingdom. Her prince would be the best-looking man in the entire world. He would be strong and perfect in every way, and capable of loving her properly. So Afiong the princess continued to disobey her parents, at which they were very much grieved. 
One day, there was commotion within the village. “What could be happening?” people enquired. Not long after, the news got to the palace, a very fine man had been seen in the market, who was better-looking than any of the natives. Afiong rushed to the market at once, and directly she saw the most handsome man she had ever set her eyes on. She fell in love immediately, and invited him to her house. The prince was delighted, and went home with her.
On his arrival, the handsome prince was introduced by Afiong to her parents. The prince immediately asked their consent to marry their daughter. At first they refused, as they did not wish her to marry a stranger, but at last they agreed. He lived with Afiong for two days in her parents' house, and then said he wished to take his wife back to his country, which was far off. To this the princess readily agreed, as he was such a fine man, but her parents tried to persuade her not to go. However, being very headstrong, she made up her mind to go, and they started off together. It was a sad day for the king and the queen.
After walking for several days, Afiong and her husband crossed the border between the spirit land and the human land. Immediately they set foot in the spirit land, strange things began to happen. First of all one man came to the prince and demanded his legs, then another his head, and the next his body, and so on, until in a few minutes the prince was left with an nothing but a skull. 
The princess became terrified. She could not understand what had happened to her handsome prince. The prince then laughed at the princess and confessed that the princess was now seeing him in his natural state. He had borrowed all his body parts from the other spirits so he would look human when he went to ask for her hand in marriage. In fact, his entire body consisted of only a human skull. 
The princess wanted to return home, but the skull would not allow this, and ordered her to go with him. When they arrived at the skull's house they found his mother, who was a very old woman quite incapable of doing any work. She could only creep about. Afiong tried her best to help her, and cooked her food, and brought water and firewood for the old woman. The old creature was very grateful for these attentions, and soon became quite fond of Afiong.
One day the old woman felt very sorry for Afiong, and decided to help her. She promised to send her back to her country as soon as possible, providing that she promised that in the future she would obey her parents. This Afiong readily consented to do. Then the old woman sent for the spider, who was a very clever hairdresser, and made him dress Afiong's hair in the latest fashion. She also presented her with anklets and other things on account of her kindness. She then used her supernatural power to call the breeze to gently carry Afiong to her father’s kingdom. Soon afterwards, the breeze deposited Afiong outside her home, and left her there.
When the king and the queen saw their daughter they were very glad, as they had for some months given her up as lost. There was feasting and dancing throughout the kingdom for eight days and nights. Afterwards, the king  passed a law that parents should never allow their daughters to marry strangers who came from a far country. Then the prince from a neighbouring village came to ask for Afiong’s hand in marriage and she willingly consented, and lived with him for many years, and had many children.
